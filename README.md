# WISETutorial

This project extends the capabilities of the [WISE Toolkit](https://github.com/coc-gatech-newelba/WISETutorial "WISE Tutorial")

## Background & Tutorial
* An introduction to the WISE Toolkit & its uses can be found in [proposal.pdf](./proposal.pdf "Project Proposal"). Note, this toolkit was designed to support many of the experiments I proposed.
* A tutorial on how to run experiments & use the toolkit can be found [here](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~ral3/tutorial2.html "Tutorial").
* The original toolkit can be found [here](https://github.com/coc-gatech-newelba/WISETutorial "Previous Generation Toolkit").
